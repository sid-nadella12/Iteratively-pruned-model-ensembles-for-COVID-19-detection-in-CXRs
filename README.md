# Iteratively-pruned-model-ensembles-for-COVID-19-detection-in-CXRs
We demonstrate use of iteratively pruned deep learning (DL) model ensembles for detecting the “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) infection with chest X-rays (CXRs). The disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and a selection of pretrained CNN models are trained on publicly available CXR collections to learn CXR modality-specific feature representations and the learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying normal, bacterial pneumonia, and CXRs exhibiting COVID-19 abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to identify optimal number of neurons in the convolutional layers to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. 

The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. The custom and pretrained CNNs are evaluated at the patient-level to alleviate issues due to information leakage and reduce generalization errors. 

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs as compared to the individual constituent models. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions. We expect that this model can be quickly adopted for COVID-19 screening using chest radiographs.

We used Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations to interpret the behavior of the learned top-3 pruned models in this study. 

The attached notebook discusses: preprocessing to convert DICOM and JPEG images to PNG, generation of lung masks using dropout-U-Net, segmentation and lung bounding box cropping, storing bounding boxes and disease ROI coordinates in the CSV files, performing modlaity-specific knowledge transfer and fine-tuning, iteative pruning, enmseble of the iteratively pruned models, and visualization of the learned behavior of the top-3 pruned models in this study, using Grad-CAM and LIME visualization techniques.

## Codes and Model weights

The weights of the best-performing, iteratively pruned DL models (VGG-16, VGG-19, and Inception-V3) are uploaded to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ec894pKM4LUJx_m0rJmj2y7FgawphBhO?usp=sharing. We found that the VGG-16 model pruned to remove 20% of the filters with the highest APoZ from each layer, VGG-19 model pruned to remove 6% of the filters with the highest APoZ, and Inception-V3 model, pruned to remove 30% of the filters with the highest APoZ from each layer delivred superior classification performance toward classifying CXRs as normal or showing bacterial or COVID-19 viral pneumonia-related opacities. The performance of the pruned and unpruned, baseline models is discussed in the IEEE Access publication available at  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9121222. The percentage reduction in the computational parameters of the pruned models is as shown below:
```
Models	          % Reduction
VGG-16-U		 
VGG-16-P	          46.03
VGG-19-U		 
VGG-19-P	          16.13
Inception-V3-U	 
Inception-V3-P	    36.10

```

### Using the trained models

First, use the unet.hdf5 weights file in the shared google drive link to generate lung masks of 256×256 pixel resolution. Use the following code snippet to crop the lung boundaries using the generated lung masks and store them as a bounding box containing all the lung pixels, as shown below:

```
model = load_model("C:/Users/trained_model/unet.hdf5")
model.summary()
test_path = "C:/Users/data/test" #where your test data resides
save_path = "C:/Users/data/membrane/result" #where you want the generated lung masks to be stored

                    zoom_range=0.3,
                    horizontal_flip=True,
                    fill_mode='nearest') 

testGene = testGenerator(test_path)
results = model.predict_generator(testGene,steps per epoch=135,verbose=1, workers=1, use_multiprocessing=False) #steps per epoch is the no. of samples in test image.
saveResult(save_path, results, test_path)

Use the generated lung crops for your test data and then used the pruned weights available in the shared google drive link to predict on your data. Give the path to your directory where you have stored the images to be predicted. The data folder is organized as: 
data 
|-train
  |-normal
  |-bacterial
  |covid-viral
|-test
  |-normal
  |-bacterial
  |covid-viral
  
 We used Keras Imageenerator to preprocess the testimages as follows:
 
 ```
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
test_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        test_data_dir,
        target_size=(256, 256),
        batch_size=batch_size,
        class_mode='categorical',
        shuffle=False)

nb_test_samples = len(test_generator.filenames)
print(test_generator.class_indices)
#true labels
Y_test=test_generator.classes
print(Y_test.shape)
#convert test labels to categorical
Y_test1=to_categorical(Y_test, num_classes=num_classes, dtype='float32')
print(Y_test1.shape)
```
Predict on the test images as follows:

```
model = load_model('vgg16_pruning_20percent.h5') 
model.summary()
sgd = SGD(lr=1e-3, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.95, nesterov=True) 
model.compile(optimizer=sgd,
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
test_generator.reset()
gg16_y_pred = model.predict_generator(test_generator, 
                                              nb_test_samples/batch_size, workers=1)
#true labels
Y_test=test_generator.classes
#print the shape of y_pred and Y_test
print(vgg16_y_pred.shape)
print(Y_test.shape)
vgg16_model_accuracy=accuracy_score(Y_test,vgg16_y_pred.argmax(axis=-1))
print('The accuracy of custom VGG16 model is: ', vgg16_model_accuracy)
```

Repeat the above steps for each of the pruned models. You can further use the pruned model weights to perform ensembles at your preference.
